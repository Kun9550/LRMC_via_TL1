# Noisy Low-Rank Matrix Completion via Transformed $L_1$ Regularization and its Theoretical Properties

**Coatshopping dataset:** https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/mnar/

**Movielens100K dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset

This data sets from u1.base and u1.test through u5.base and u5.test are 80%/20% splits of the u data into training and test data.

The demo is an example of implementation for the paper:
Kun Zhao, Jiayi Wang, and Yifei Lou. Noisy low-rank matrix completion via transformed $L_1$ regularization and its theoretical properties. In The 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2025. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=S3zU0LbfZ1.
